# @andrei-tatar/node-red-contrib-nibetcp

Node-RED integration for Nibe heatpumps that use modbus over TCP.
Only tested with Nibe S1155, 2 x ECS 40 and one NIBE ERS S40, for which the exported registers are embedded in this package.

You can use your own exported CSV file with the registers from your system.
